<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This is an advanced undergraduate course on modern foundations of analysis. 
The official course syllabus asks that we cover the general theory of integration, based on the concept of measure. 
We will begin with an introduction to general topology, focusing on Euclidean space and spaces of functions. 
We will work toward integration over manifolds, in particular, the important <i>generalized Stokes' theorem</i> and its applications.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We will be working from Andrew Browder's <i><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4612-0715-3" target="_blank">Mathematical analysis : an introduction</a></i>.</p>


<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and one final, each in a take-home format. Each of these exams is worth 20% of your final grade. </p>

including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. 
However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
