[ALGTOP-L] How well-defined is "kappa-bar" in the stable 20-stem?

Dear algtop-readers,

How well-defined is "kappa-bar" in the stable 20-stem?

I asked this on MathOverflow some weeks ago, but received no comments or 
answers.  The formatting at

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/319204/how-well-defined-is-bar-kappa-in-the-stable-20-stem

may be easier to read.  Does someone here know more about this?

Quick review:

The 2-completed stable 20-stem \pi_{20}(S)_2 is cyclic of order 8.

Mimura and Toda (1963, Lemma 15.4) MR157384 show the existence (but not a 
choice) of a class \bar\kappa_7 in \pi_27(S^7) whose stable class 
\bar\kappa generates \pi_{20}(S)_2.  Equivalently, \bar\kappa is detected 
by the class g in E^{4,24}_2 = E^{4,24}_\infty in the mod 2 Adams spectral 
sequence.

Note that these descriptions only determine \bar\kappa up to an odd 
multiple, i.e., up to a factor in {1,3,5,7}.

Kochman (1990, page 104 and Lemma 5.3.8(e)) MR1052407 finds a generator 
C[20] = d^{12}(\nu^3 M_1^3 \bar M_2) for \pi_{20}(S)_2, which is an 
element of the four-fold Toda bracket <\nu, \eta, 2, A[14]>, where I 
believe A[14] = \kappa.

Bauer (2008, equation (8.1)) MR2508200 sets \bar\kappa equal to the 
four-fold Toda bracket <\kappa, 2, \eta, \nu>.

According to Kochman's Theorem 2.3.1(b) the indeterminacy of each of these 
four-fold brackets is \nu \pi_{17}(S) = Z/2, generated by 4 \bar\kappa. 
Hence these descriptions only determine \bar\kappa up to a factor in 
{1,5}.

Here is my question:

Is there a way to uniquely specify an element \bar\kappa that generates 
\pi_{20}(S) (modulo the odd torsion)?

Best regards,

I learned long ago from Mahowald that the element kappa-bar  is represented by Sp(3)/S^1 in a suitable framing.   I'm afraid I don't have the story of the framing at my fingertips any longer, but perhaps others do.   I don't know a reference but I was under the impression that the observation is due to Ossa.

Here are a few miscellaneous and not necessarily helpful points.

The Toda bracket <kappa, 2, eta, nu> that John Rognes mentioned is the best decomposition of kappa-bar that I know.  

Maybe there is a 4-fold matric Toda bracket for kappa-bar built from Toda's relation nu^3 + eta (eta sigma + epsilon) = 0, since g = b21^2 and b21 is the reason that h1^2 h3 + h2^3 = 0.  Even if it could be constructed, there's no guarantee that the indeterminacy won't interfere.  [This would be a Sq^0-analogue of Peter May's 4-fold Massey product for v1^4 = b20^2 in the cohomology of A(2), using the relation h0^2 h2 + h1^3 = 0.]  

Since nu kappa-bar also has order 8, it would be enough to specify nu kappa-bar uniquely.  But I don't know how to do that either.  There is an interesting Toda bracket <2, 8 sigma, 2, sigma^2> that contains nu kappa-bar, but its indeterminacy includes 2 nu kappa-bar, so that's apparently not helpful.  

kappa-bar is detected in Adams-Novikov filtration 2, while 2 kappa-bar is detected in Adams-Novikov filtration 4.  This filtration shift perhaps explains why the definition is so elusive.  

I hate to admit it, but I have to wonder, as Mike Hopkins suggests, that some geometry is required.

One further point.   It occurs to me that what you my actually want is a specific isomorphism from the 20-stem to Z/24, or at least some specified group of order 24.   The Adams-Novikov spectral sequence represents this as an extension of a group of order 2 by a cyclic group of order 12.   But the descent (=Adams-Novikov) spectral sequence for tmf identifies the torsion subgroup of
\pi_20 tmf with H^4(M;\omega^12) which is cyclic of order 24, where M is a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves.

Dear John,

the stable 20 stem maps (2-locally) injectively to the K(2)-localization 
of tmf.  This localization can be identified with
the homotopy fixed points of the second Morava/Lubin-Tate spectrum E_2 
with respect to the action of a maximal finite subgroup G (of order 48) 
of the big Morava stabilizer group at n=p=2. The 20-stem is detected at 
the E_2-term of the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence converging 
towards \pi_*(E_2^{hG_{24}}) in E_2^{4,24}=H^4(G,(E_2)_{24}).

The group E_2^{4,24} is a cyclic group of order 8 and is generated by 
the product Delta k where Delta is the well-known modular form of degree 
24 and k is a periodicity generator for G in H^4(G,\W). Here \W denotes 
the ring of Witt vectors
over the field with 4 elements. The group H^4(G,\W) is isomorphic to 
H^4(SL_2(\F_3),Z_2), SL_2(\F_3) where SL_2(\F_3) is  a maximal finite 
subgroup of the small stabilizer group. It contains the quaternion group 
Q_8 as a 2-Sylow subgroup and k can be identified with a periodicity 
generator of Q_8 in H^4(Q_8,\Z_2).

So once we have fixed such a periodicity generator we have specified a 
unique generator for the stable 20-stem (2-locally). A periodicity 
generator can be obtained from a fundamental class of the quotient of 
the special unitary group SU(2) by its subgroup Q_8. There is a choice 
of orientation for this fundamental class. Maybe this choice is related
to the ambiguity in Kochman's definition of \bar\kappa.

I hope this makes sense.

Best regards,  Hans-Werner

Hi John,

Here's a way to identify \bar\kappa of a different flavor than the one Mike suggested.
Let i denote the unit map S \to tmf and let r denote the map \pi_*(tmf) \to MF_* (in this email all of these objects will be localized at 2). Now we make a couple observations: 
(1) the unit map S \to tmf is injective on \pi_20 (and an isomorphism on torsion),
(2) \pi_{23}(tmf) = 0, so every element of \pi_{20}(tmf) is \nu torsion,
(3) \pi_{24}(tmf) \subset MF_12.
Using these one can consider the operation
< i(-), \nu, 8> : \pi_{20}(S) \to \pi_{24}(tmf)/8

Next, we'll consult the Adams spectral sequence diagrams from
http://math.mit.edu/conferences/talbot/2007/tmfproc/Chapter16/TmfHomotopy.pdf
in order to evaluate this operation. In particular, we can read off that 8\triangle \in <Pd_0, \eta, 2> up to higher Adams filtration. 
Using the hidden extension \eta^2 \bar\kappa = Pd_0 and shuffling tells us that <\bar\kappa, \nu, 8> = 8\triangle up to higher Adams filtration.

Now we can identify \pi_{24}(tmf) as a subset of MF_12 and after modding out by 64 and c_4^3 the operation we've constructed will be an isomorphism onto the 8-torsion.
In this group we have a preferred generator given by the image of 8\triangle.
From this it's possible to define \bar\kappa as the unique element of \pi_{20}(S) such that 8\triangle \in r(<i(\bar\kappa), \nu, 8>) \subset MF_12/c_4^3.
