Dear Professor Blumberg, I'm submitting a revised version of my paper, currently Version 3. In Theorem 1.6 (ii), the indexing for the last summation has been corrected. More details have been included in Section 3 (proof of Theorem 1.2). At the end of Remark 1.10, a reference to recent work as applications of the main theorems has been added. Thank you. 
Sincerely, Yifei Zhu
