Dear Professor Blumberg, I'm submitting a revised version of my paper. 
Remarks 1.9 and 1.10 are new. The proposition in Section 2 has been moved and 
made into a more thorough discussion in Section 3.3 of [Zhu2015] (now 
resubmitted to Homology, Homotopy and Applications). Thank you. 
Sincerely, Yifei Zhu
