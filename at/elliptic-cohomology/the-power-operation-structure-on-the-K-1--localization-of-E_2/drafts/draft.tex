 Dyer-Lashof theories organize power operations in cohomology.  We give an 
 overview of the structure of the Dyer-Lashof theories associated to Morava 
 $E$-theories, and to their $K(1)$-localizations.  When the $E$-theory is an 
 elliptic cohomology theory, this structure enables us to compute power 
 operations by doing calculations with elliptic curves.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The study of cohomology operations has been central to algebraic topology 
since the 1950s, with applications to solving problems such as vector fields 
on spheres, and the non-existence of elements of Hopf invariant one.  This 
latter problem has impact on the author most recently felt when he tried to 
answer a question raised by students in a calculus class (the interested 
reader might see \cite[theorem II]{massey}).  

Among the cohomology operations involved in these applications, the Steenrod 
operations ${\rm Sq}^i$ in ordinary cohomology and the Adams operations 
$\psi^k$ in $K$-theory are examples of {\em power operations}.  In this paper 
we study power operations in Morava $E$-theories.  Here is an outline.  

In this section we introduce preliminary definitions, in particular, the 
Dyer-Lashof theory $\DL_{E_*}$ associated to a Morava $E$-theory $E$.  

In section \ref{sec:at2ec} we ``translate'' from $\DL_{E_*}$ and related 
categories to categories arising from the formal group and its finite flat 
subgroups associated to $E$.  This ``bridge'' is the foundation of our 
discussion, so that later we can study the structure of one side by doing 
calculations on the other side.  

In section \ref{sec:K(1)} we describe power operations in the $K(1)$-local 
setting where the structure is relatively simple.  

Section \ref{sec:p3} contains calculations of power operations for a specific 
Morava $E$-theory spectrum, and its $K(1)$-localization, at the prime 3.  
Thanks to the connection in section \ref{sec:at2ec}, we work with elliptic 
curves as concrete objects, following a recipe in hope of generalizing our 
computation to larger primes.  


\subsection{Dyer-Lashof theories}

One organizing principle for understanding the structure among cohomology 
operations is through {\em algebraic theories} (due to Lawvere, \cf{lawvere} 
and \cite[chapter 3]{borceux}).  We begin with a collection of definitions and 
simple facts concerning algebraic theories, following precisely the discussion 
in \cite[sections 5--9]{lpo}.  

\begin{defn}
 An {\em (algebraic) theory} is a category $T$ with object set 
 $\{T^0,T^1,T^2,...\}$, together with a canonical map $T^0 \to T^1$, and {\em 
 projection maps} $\pi_i\co T^n \to T^1$ for all $n \ge 1$, $1 \le i \le n$ 
 such that $T(T^k,T^n) \xrightarrow{\pi_i} \prod_{i=1}^n T(T^k,T^1)$ is a 
 bijection for all $k$ and $n$, i.e.\thinspace$T^n$ is the $n$-fold product of 
 $T^1$.  
 
 A {\em morphism of theories} is a functor $\phi\co R \to T$ which preserves 
 the product structure of a theory, i.e.\thinspace$\phi(R^k) = T^k$ and 
 $\phi(R^k \stackrel{\pi_i}{\longrightarrow} R^1) = T^k 
 \stackrel{\pi_i}{\longrightarrow} T^1$.  \qed
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
 A {\em model} of a theory $T$ (or {\em $T$-model}) is a functor 
 $A\co T \to {\rm Set}$ which preserves finite products.  \qed
\end{defn}
We can think of a model of $T$ as an underlying set $X = A(T^1)$ together with 
operations $\psi_f\co X^k \to X$ for each $f \in T(T^k,T^1)$ (these determine 
all the other operations $X^k \to X^n$ with $n>1$).  In particular, a {\em 
free model} on $n$ generators is the model $F_T(n)$ defined by $F_T(n)(T^m) = 
T(T^n,T^m)$.  We write $\Model_T$ for the category of models of $T$.  

For example, let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $F$ be the full 
subcategory of the category of commutative $R$-algebras having as objects 
$\{F_0,F_1,F_2,...\}$, where $F_0 = R$ and $F_n = R[x_1,...,x_n]$ for $n \ge 
1$.  We then have the theory of commutative $R$-algebras $C_R = F^{\rm op}$.  
The projection maps $\pi_i\co R[x_1,...,x_n] \to R[x_1]$ send $x_i$ to $x_1$ 
and send $x_j$, $j \neq i$, to 0.  

\begin{defn}
 A {\em commutative operation theory} (COT) is a triple $(T,R,\phi)$ 
 consisting of a theory $T$, a commutative ring $R$, and a morphism 
 $\phi\co C_R \to T$ of theories, such that the induced functor 
 $\phi^*\co \Model_T \to \Model_{C_R}$ commutes with finite coproducts.  \qed
\end{defn}
In other words, if $T$ is a COT, every $T$-model has an underlying structure 
of a commutative $R$-algebra, and coproducts in $\Model_T$ are computed as 
tensor products over $R$ (we will use $\otimes$ when writing coproducts).  We 
denote by $R\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ a free $T$-model on $n$ generators, and we have 
$R\{x_1,...,x_n\} \cong R\{x_1\} \otimes_R \cdots \otimes_R R\{x_n\}$.  

We next introduce grading to a theory.  
\begin{defn}
 Let $C$ be a fixed set $C$ of {\em colors}, and let ${\mb N}[C]$ be the free 
 commutative monoid on $C$.  A {\em $C$-graded theory} $T$ is a category with 
 object set $\{T^n\}_{n \in {\mb N}[C]}$, together with, for each 
 $n = \sum_{c \in C} n_c[c] \in {\mb N}[C]$, a specified identification of 
 $T^n$ with the product $\prod_{c \in C} (T^{[c]})^{n_c}$.  \qed
\end{defn}
In particular, given a $\mb Z$-graded theory $T$ and a graded-commutative ring 
$R$, we can define a graded COT as a triple $(T,R_*,\phi)$ similarly to the 
above (the theory $C_{R_*}$ of graded-commutative $R_*$-algebras is equipped 
with the graded tensor product).  Given a $T$-model $A$, we write $A_c$ for 
the piece in grading $c$ of the model.  

For a graded COT $(T,R_*,\phi)$, and free models $R_*\{x\}$ and 
$R_*\{x_1,x_2\}$ with $|x| = |x_1| = |x_2| = c$, let ${\cal A}(c,d)$ be the 
set of elements $f \in R_*\{x\}_d = T(T^{[c]},T^{[d]})$ which are primitive 
under the comultiplication $R_*\{x\} \xrightarrow{x \mapsto x_1 + x_2} 
R_*\{x_1,x_2\}$, i.e.\thinspace{$f$} $\mapsto f \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes f$.  
Such $f \in {\cal A}(c,d)$ give rise to additive maps $A_c \to A_d$ natural in 
$A$.  In particular $x \in R_*\{x\}_c$ corresponds to the identity map on 
$A_c$.  Thus we obtain a category $\cal A$ of additive operations whose object 
set is $\mb Z$, the set of colors of our graded COT.  

For example, let $T = O_{H{\mb F}_p}$ be the graded COT given by 
\[
 T(O_{H{\mb F}_p}^{[c_1]+\cdots+[c_m]}, O_{H{\mb F}_p}^{[d_1]+\cdots+[d_n]}) 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\]
\[
 = [K({\mb F}_p,c_1) \times \cdots \times K({\mb F}_p,c_m), 
 K({\mb F}_p,d_1) \times \cdots \times K({\mb F}_p,d_n)], 
\]
where we use homotopy classes of maps, and by convention $K({\mb F}_p,c) = *$ 
for $c<0$.  $\Model_{O_{H{\mb F}_p}}$ is the category of unstable algebras 
over the mod-$p$ Steenrod algebra (this is a restatement of results of Serre 
\cite{serre} and Cartan \cite{cartan}; see \cite[II.\S5]{steenrod}).  
${\cal A}(c,d)$ is the set of additive operations 
$H^c(-;{\mb F}_p) \to H^d(-;{\mb F}_p)$.  If $p=2$, the additive operations 
$H^c(-;{\mb F}_2) \to H^*(-;{\mb F}_2)$ are linear combinations of monomials 
which are admissible composites of Steenrod operations having excess less than 
$c$ (\cff{theorem 2 of \S4}{serre} and 
\cite[chapters 3 and 9]{moshertangora}).  

Having the COT describing cohomology operations on spaces, we next consider 
one describing operations on spectra.  

Let $S$ be the sphere spectrum, and $R$ be a commutative $S$-algebra 
(\cf{EKMM}).  We denote by $\Alg_R$ the category of commutative $R$-algebras.  
Let $\mb P$ be the {\em free $S$-algebra functor} defined by 
\[
 {\mb P}(X) = \bigvee_{m \ge 0} {\mb P}^m(X) = \bigvee_{m \ge 0} 
 X^{\wedge m}/\Sigma_m, 
\]
and let ${\mb P}_R$ be the {\em free $R$-algebra functor} defined similarly 
using the smash product over $R$.  These functors descend to the homotopy 
categories.  
\begin{defn}
\label{def:DL}
 Given a commutative $S$-algebra $R$, the {\em Dyer-Lashof theory}  $\DL_R$ is 
 the $\mb Z$-graded theory $T$ defined by 
 \[
  T(T^{[c_1]+\cdots+[c_m]},T^{[d_1]+\cdots+[d_n]}) 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 \]
 $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= h\Alg_R \Big({\mb P}_R \big(R \wedge (S^{d_1} \vee \cdots 
 \vee S^{d_n}) \big), {\mb P}_R \big(R \wedge (S^{c_1} \vee \cdots \vee 
 S^{c_m}) \big) \Big)$.  \qed
\end{defn}
The significance of $\DL_R$ is that it describes all homotopy operations on 
commutative $R$-algebras (as natural transformations of the functors 
$\pi_i(-)$): 
\[
 T(T^{[c]},T^{[d]}) = h\Alg_R \big( {\mb P}_R(R \wedge S^d), 
 {\mb P}_R(R \wedge S^c) \big) = \{\pi_c(-) \to \pi_d(-)\}.  
\]

Free models are given by 
\[
 F_T([c_1]+\cdots+[c_m])_d = \pi_d {\mb P}_R  \big( R \wedge (S^{c_1} \vee 
 \cdots \vee S^{c_m}) \big) = \pi_d \Big( R \wedge \big({\mb P}(S^{c_1}) \vee 
 \cdots \vee {\mb P}(S^{c_m})\big) \Big).  
\]
If $\pi_*\big(R\wedge{\mb P}(S^c)\big)$ are flat as left $\pi_*R$-modules, 
$\DL_R$ turns out to be a COT (\cff{lemma 7.5}{lpo}).  Moreover, in the 
homotopy category, it is convenient to identify ${\mb P}^m (S^c)$ with 
$B\Sigma_m^{cV_m}$.  The latter is the Thom spectrum of a virtual bundle, 
where $V_m = {\mb R}^m$ is equipped with the $\Sigma_m$-action given by 
permuting coordinates.  

For example, if $R$ is a ring (no longer a spectrum) containing ${\mb F}_2$ 
and $HR$ is the corresponding Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, there is a complete 
description of the COT $\DL_{HR}$.  A $\DL_{HR}$-model is a graded commutative 
$R$-algebra $A_*$, equipped with functions $Q^s\co A_c \to A_{c+s}$ for all 
$s, c \in {\mb Z}$, satisfying a set of properties, e.g.\thinspace{a} Cartan 
formula and Adem relations (\cff{VIII.3.3}{BMMS} and \cite[section 10]{lpo}).  


\subsection{Morava $E$-theories and associated Dyer-Lashof theories}

One organizing principle for understanding large-scale phenomena in homotopy 
theory is through the {\em chromatic filtration} (\cf{tafoverview}, 
\cite[section 17]{coctalos}, \cite[section 2.5]{orange} and \cite{green}).  It 
corresponds to a stratification of the moduli stack of formal groups into 
layers according to height (in this paper all formal groups are commutative of 
dimension 1; \cff{III.\S1}{fg}).  For complex oriented cohomology theories, 
the formal groups come about in terms of formal group laws which express the 
first Chern class of the tensor product of two line bundles in terms of the 
first Chern classes of the individual line bundles 
(\cff{section 1}{coctalos}).  

For each formal group law $F$ of height $n<\infty$ over a perfect field $k$ of 
characteristic $p>0$, there is a complete local ring $\LT(k,F)$, called the 
Lubin-Tate ring.  It is universal among complete local rings with residue 
field $k$ carrying a formal group law whose reduction to $k$ is $F$.  As $k$ 
is perfect, $\LT(k,F)$ is isomorphic to ${\mb W}k 
\llbracket u_1,...,u_{n-1} \rrbracket$ (\cff{sections 4.3 and 4.5}{H-Mthm}).  
There is an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum $E_n(k,F)$ whose homotopy groups are 
$\LT(k,F)[u^{\pm1}]$ with $|u| = 2$ (\cff{corollary 7.6}{GH} and 
\cite{H-Mthm}).  This is the {\em Morava $E$-theory} spectrum (associated to 
$k$ and $F$).  

Closely related to Morava $E$-theories are $E(n)$ ({\em Johnson-Wilson 
theories}) and $K(n)$ ({\em Morava $K$-theories}) for $n \ge 0$, with 
$\pi_*E(n) = {\mb Z}_{(p)}[v_1,...,v_n,v_n^{-1}]$, and 
$\pi_*K(n) = {\mb F}_p[v_n,v_n^{-1}]$, where $|v_i| = 2(p^i-1)$, and by 
convention $v_0 = p$.  They are particularly useful when we study specific 
layers in the chromatic filtration through {\em Bousfield localization} 
(\cff{chapter 7}{orange} and \cite[lectures 20--23]{252x}).  In 
\cite{bousfield}, for each generalized homology theory $E$, Bousfield defines 
an idempotent functor $L_E$ on the stable homotopy category whose image is 
equivalent to the category of fractions defined by Adams in 
\cite[section III.14]{sh}.  Via the connection to the moduli stack of formal 
groups, geometrically we can think of the stable homotopy category as 
approximated by a category of quasicoherent sheaves on a moduli stack $\cal M$ 
which has a sequence of open substacks ${\cal M}(n)$.  The Bousfield 
localization $L_{E(n)}$ can be thought of as restricting to the open substack 
${\cal M}(n)$.  The difference ${\cal M}(n) \setminus {\cal M}(n-1)$ between 
two adjacent layers is a closed substack of ${\cal M}(n)$, and $L_{K(n)}$ acts 
as completing along this closed substack.  Roughly speaking, $L_{K(n)}$ has 
the effect of isolating height $n$ phenomena, and $L_{E(n)}$ sees all 
phenomena of height $n$ and lower.  Thus to understand the stable homotopy 
category, we can first examine one chromatic layer at a time and do specific 
calculations for $K(n)$-localizations.  Then we need to understand how to 
patch these together into the $E(n)$-localizations, and we need to understand 
the ``chromatic convergence'', i.e.\thinspace{h}ow to take the limit as $n$ 
goes to infinity.  

In the chromatic filtration, ordinary rational cohomology lives over the open 
substack ${\cal M}(0)$ and $K$-theory lives over ${\cal M}(1)$.  The open 
substack ${\cal M}(2)$ is where {\em elliptic cohomology theories} 
(\cf{survey}) are concentrated.  An elliptic cohomology theory has its 
associated formal group equipped with a chosen isomorphism to the formal 
completion of an elliptic curve along the identity; see 
\cite[definition 1.2]{survey} for precise definition.  In this paper we study 
the $K(1)$-localization of $E_2$, i.e.\thinspace{t}he localization to height 1 
of a certain Morava $E$-theory of height 2 which is an elliptic cohomology 
theory.  Specifically we study the power operations for $E_2$ and its 
$K(1)$-localization.  (Within context, $E_2$ is not to be confused with the 
homotopy group in degree 2 of a theory $E$.)  

Given a Morava $E$-theory $E$, there is an associated Dyer-Lashof theory 
$\DL_{E_*}$ describing all cohomology operations.  It is defined similarly as 
in definition \ref{def:DL}, except that we need to apply a certain 
localization to have good values of $E_* B\Sigma_m$ 
(\cff{section 3}{strickland} and \cite[section 8]{hoveystrickland}).  The free 
model on one generator is $E_*\{x_c\} = \bigoplus_{m \ge 0} E_*^\wedge 
(B\Sigma_m^{cV_m})$, where $E_*^\wedge (-)$ reflects the localization.  (We 
need to be slightly careful about this localization, as it does not preserve 
homotopy colimits; \cff{section 15}{lpo} and \cite[section 1]{hovey} for 
details.)  

As is explained at the beginning of \cite{Andu}, we hope to learn about the 
conjectural geometry of the theories $E_n$ by examining cohomology operations 
-- in particular, power operations -- along the lines of ordinary rational 
cohomology or $K$-theory (which are the initial cases $E_0$ and $E_1$).  


\section{The structure of power operations}
\label{sec:at2ec}

Let $E$ be the Morava $E$-theory associated to a formal group $\Gamma$ of 
height $n<\infty$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$.  Based on 
knowledge of the spectrum $E$, we study the structure of $\DL_{E_*}$, the 
$\mb Z$-graded Dyer-Lashof theory describing all homotopy operations on 
commutative $E$-algebras.  We restrict our attention to the degree 0 part 
$\DL_{E_0}$.  We can translate operations in higher degree $E$-cohomology to 
degree 0 by working with higher sphere spectra $S^n$; even better, Morava 
$E$-theories are even-periodic (recall that $E_* = \LT(k,\Gamma)[u^{\pm1}]$ 
with $|u| = 2$) so that a lot of operations are already determined by those in 
degree 0.  

To understand the structure of $\DL_{E_0}$, the main input comes from 
deformations of Frobenius which we discuss below.  In particular, when the 
$E$-theory is an elliptic cohomology theory, deformations of Frobenius are 
parametrized by finite flat subgroups of the formal group of the associated 
elliptic curve, and thus we may study the operations by calculations with 
elliptic curves.  Also the Serre-Tate theorem (\cff{theorem 1.2.1}{katz}) 
states that $p$-adically the deformation theory of an elliptic curve is 
equivalent to the deformation theory of its $p$-divisible group.  As Morava 
$E$-theories are associated to the latter, this important result enables our 
approach to power operations in elliptic cohomology, and it underlies the 
later discussion.  

This section is largely a summary of some of the results in 
\cite[section 16]{lpo} and \cite[sections 3 and 4]{h2p2}.  See \cite{slides} 
for an exposition of related topics.  

\subsection{Identifications of categories}
\label{subsec:id}

First we consider additive operations.  

Let $\CA$ be the set of additive elements in the free $\DL_{E_0}$-model on one 
generator $E_0\{x\} = \bigoplus_{m \ge 0} E_0^\wedge B\Sigma_m$.  Write 
$\CA_{[m]} \subset E_0^\wedge B\Sigma_m$ for the summand, and write 
$\CA_r = \CA_{[p^r]}$.  It turns out that $\CA_{[m]} = 0$ unless $m = p^r$ for 
some $r$ (\cff{lemma 8.10}{strickland}).  Thus 
$\CA = \bigoplus_{r \ge 0} \CA_r$ is an associative (not necessarily 
commutative) graded ring with respect to the product given by ``composition of 
operations'', with the unit element given by the generator $x \in E_0\{x\}$ 
representing the identity operation.  Moreover the category $\Mod_\CA$ of left 
$\CA$-modules naturally admits a tensor product which makes it into a 
symmetric monoidal category (\cff{proposition 7.6}{lpo}).  

We formulate a category equivalent to $\Mod_\CA$, which is specific to Morava 
$E$-theories, using deformations of Frobenius.  

Let $R$ be a complete local ring containing ${\mb F}_p$.  Given an $R$-algebra 
$A$, let $\Frob^*\co \sigma^*A \to A$ be the unique map of $R$-algebras that 
fits into the diagram 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (LT) at (0, 2) {$R$}; 
        \node (MT) at (2, 2) {$R$}; 
	\node (RT) at (4, 2) {$R$}; 
        \node (LB) at (0, 0) {$A$}; 
        \node (MB) at (2, 0) {$\sigma^*A$}; 
	\node (RB) at (4, 0) {$A$}; 
	\node at (4.2, -0.125) {,}; 
	\node at (1.6, 0.4) {$\ulcorner$}; 
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$\scriptstyle \sigma$} (MT); 
	\draw [double distance=1.3pt] (MT) -- (RT); 
	\draw [->] (LT) -- (LB); 
	\draw [->] (MT) -- (MB); 
	\draw [->] (RT) -- (RB); 
        \draw [->] (LB) -- (MB); 
	\draw [->] (MB) -- node [above] {$\scriptstyle \text{Frob}^*$} (RB); 
	\draw [->] (LB) to [out = -30, in = -150] node [below] 
		   {$\scriptstyle \sigma$} (RB); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where $\sigma$ sends an element to its $p$'th power, and the left-hand square 
is a pushout of rings.  In particular, if $G$ is a formal group over $R$, 
there is an isogeny $\Frob\co G \to \sigma^*G$ of formal groups over $R$ 
defined by $\Frob^*\co \CO_{\sigma^*G} = \sigma^*\CO_G \to \CO_G$, 
$R \llbracket y \rrbracket \to R \llbracket x \rrbracket$ sending $y$ to 
$x^p$.  

The Frobenius can be defined more generally for any complete local ring $R$ 
with maximal ideal $\mf m$ (and $R$-algebras), by imposing the above 
commutative diagram on their mod-$p$ reductions.  This is indeed the 
generality we will be working with henceforth.  Our restricted first 
definition is simply for the clarity of exposition.  

A {\em deformation of $\Gamma$ to $R$} is a triple $(G,i,\alpha)$ consisting 
of a formal group $G$ over $R$, an inclusion $i\co k \to R/\mf m$ and an 
isomorphism $\alpha\co \pi^*G \to i^*\Gamma$ of formal groups over $R/\mf m$, 
where $\pi\co R \to R/\mf m$ is the natural quotient map.  (We will simply 
write $\pi^*G$ as $G_0$, i.e.\thinspace{t}he special fiber of $G$ as a formal 
scheme over $R$.  Similarly, given an isogeny $\phi$ of formal groups, we 
write $\phi_0$ for the induced isogeny on the special fibers.)  A {\em 
$\star$-isomorphism $(G,i,\alpha) \to (G',i',\alpha')$} is an isomorphism 
$\phi\co G \to G'$ of formal groups over $R$ such that $i' = i$ and 
$\alpha' \circ \phi_0 = \alpha$.  

We define the {\em category of deformations of Frobenius over $R$} as follows.  
\begin{defn}
 Let $\DF(R)$ be the category whose objects are deformations of $\Gamma$ to 
 $R$, and whose morphisms are isogenies which are deformations of Frobenius, 
 i.e.\thinspace{a} morphism $(G,i,\alpha) \to (G',i',\alpha')$ is an isogeny 
 $\phi\co G \to G'$ such that $i' = \sigma^r \circ i$ and 
 $\alpha' \circ \phi_0 = \Frob^r \circ \alpha$ for some $r \ge 0$.  \qed
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:star}
 In the above definition, when $r = 0$, a morphism 
 $(G,i,\alpha) \to (G',i',\alpha')$ is precisely a $\star$-isomorphism.  \qed
\end{rmk}

We then consider the category of sheaves of modules on $\DF = \{\DF(R)\}$.  
\begin{defn}
\label{def:mod}
 Define a category $\Mod_\DF$ as follows.  An object $\cal F$ of this category 
 consists of 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item for each complete local ring $R$, a functor
  \[
  {\cal F}_R\co \DF(R)^{\rm op} \to \Mod_R, 
  \]
  \item for each local homomorphism $f\co R \to S$, a natural isomorphism 
  \[
  {\cal F}_f\co f^*{\cal F}_R \to {\cal F}_{S}f^*, 
  \]
  where the first $f^*$ is the functor $\Mod_R \to \Mod_{S}$ of extending 
  scalars along $f$, and the second 
  $f^*\co \DF(R)^{\rm op} \to \DF(S)^{\rm op}$ is induced by $f$ ($\DF(-)$ is 
  a functor), 
 \end{enumerate}
 together with natural isomorphisms 
 \[
  {\cal F}_{\rm id} \cong {\rm id}~~\text{and}~~ 
  {\cal F}_{gf} \cong {\cal F}_g(f^*) \circ g^*({\cal F}_f) 
 \]
 for all local homomorphisms ${\rm id}\co R \to R$, $f\co R \to S$ and 
 $g\co S \to T$.  

 A morphism $\eta\co {\cal F} \to {\cal G}$ in this category is a collection 
 of natural transformations $\eta_R\co {\cal F}_R \to {\cal G}_R$ together 
 with natural isomorphisms ${\cal G}_f \circ f^*(\eta_R) \cong 
 \eta_{S}(f^*) \circ {\cal F}_f$.  \qed
\end{defn}
For example, there is an object $\CO$ of $\Mod_\DF$ described as follows.  
$\CO_R$ is the functor sending deformations to their base ring $R$ and sending 
morphisms between deformations to the identity map of $R$.  $\CO_f$ is 
determined by the isomorphism $R \otimes_R^f S \to S$, 
$r \otimes s \mapsto f(r) s$.  The natural isomorphisms 
$\CO_{\rm id} \cong {\rm id}$ and $\CO_{gf} \cong \CO_g(f^*) \circ g^*(\CO_f)$ 
are determined by the isomorphisms $R \otimes_R^{\rm id} R \to R$, 
$r_1 \otimes r_2 \mapsto r_1 r_2$, and 
$R \otimes_R^{gf} T \to (R \otimes_R^f S) \otimes_S^g T$, 
$r \otimes t \mapsto (r \otimes 1) \otimes t$, respectively.  See 
\cite[11.13 and 11.17]{cong}.  
\begin{rmk}
 $\Mod_\DF$ is a symmetric monoidal category with the tensor product 
 ${\cal F} \otimes {\cal G}$ given by 
 $({\cal F} \otimes {\cal G})_R(G) = {\cal F}_R(G) \otimes_R {\cal G}_R(G)$.  
 \qed
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}[{\cite[pre-theorem 16.4]{lpo}}]
 The symmetric monoidal categories $\Mod_\CA$ and $\Mod_\DF$ are equivalent.  
 \qed
\end{thm}

Next we consider $\Model_{\DL_{E_0}}$, the category of models for the theory 
$\DL_{E_0}$, on which $\CA$ acts.  By \cite[proposition 7.6]{lpo}, there is a 
forgetful functor $\Model_{\DL_{E_0}} \to \Mod_\CA$ along which the coproduct 
of $\DL_{E_0}$-models and the tensor product of $\Mod_\CA$ agree.  
\begin{defn}
\label{def:alg}
 Define a category $\Alg_\DF$ as follows.  An object $\cal B$ of this category 
 is a ring object in $\Mod_\DF$ which satisfies the {\em Frobenius 
 congruence}, i.e.\thinspace{t}he diagram 
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
         \node (LT) at (0, 2) {$\sigma^*{\cal B}_R(G)$}; 
         \node (RT) at (3, 2) {${\cal B}_R\sigma^*(G)$}; 
         \node (RB) at (3, 0) {${\cal B}_R(G)$}; 
         \draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$\scriptstyle {\cal B}_\sigma(G)$} 
                            node [below] {$\scriptstyle \sim$} (RT); 
         \draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$\scriptstyle \Frob^*$} (RB); 
         \draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$\scriptstyle {\cal B}_R(\Frob)$} 
		    (RB); 
 \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{center}
 commutes for all complete local rings $R$ and deformations $G$ of $\Gamma$ to 
 $R$.  

 Morphisms in this category are maps of ring objects.  

 An object ${\cal B}$ is said to be {\em torsion free} if  ${\cal B}_R(G)$ is 
 $p$-torsion free for every $p$-torsion free $R$ and every deformation $G$ to 
 $R$.  We denote by $\Alg_\DF^{\rm tf}$ the full subcategory of $\Alg_\DF$ 
 consisting of torsion free objects.  \qed
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}
 We note as in \cite[11.18]{cong} that roughly speaking, the Frobenius 
 congruence is the requirement that $\cal B$ carry the Frobenius on formal 
 groups to the Frobenius on algebras.  \qed
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}[{\cite[pre-theorem 16.5]{lpo}}]
 There is a forgetful functor $\Model_{\DL_{E_0}} \to \Alg_\DF$ which 
 restricts to an equivalence $\Model_{\DL_{E_0}}^{\rm tf} \cong 
 \Alg_\DF^{\rm tf}$ between the full subcategories of torsion free objects.  
 \qed
\end{thm}


\subsection{Deformations of Frobenius are parametrized by subgroups}
\label{subsec:subgp}

Having identified the categories, we now analyze the essential data that are 
encoded in $\Mod_\DF$ and $\Alg_\DF^{\rm tf}$, by studying the structure of 
the category $\DF(R)$ of deformations of Frobenius.  This turns out to be 
parametrized by the finite flat subgroups of deformations of $\Gamma$ to $R$, 
as we explain below.

Choosing a coordinate $x$ on a formal group $G$ over $R$, a {\em degree} (or 
{\em rank}) {\em $d$ subgroup $K$ of $G$} is an effective divisor on $G$ with 
$\CO_K = R \llbracket x \rrbracket / \big(f(x)\big)$ for some degree $d$ monic 
polynomial $f(x)$ such that $f(x_1 +_G x_2) \in \big(f(x_1),f(x_2)\big)$ and 
$f(x) \in (x)$.  In other words, the group law of $G$ restricts to $K$, and 
$K$ contains the identity.  In particular $K$ is finite and flat over $R$ (we 
will assume finiteness and flatness of subgroups even when we do not mention 
their degrees).  We can define the {\em quotient group} $G/K$ which is again a 
formal group (\cff{section 5}{strick}).  

One can show that the homomorphism $[d]_G\co G \to G$ restricts to zero on $K$ 
(\cff{section 1}{tateoort}).  More concretely, this means that $f(x)$ 
must divide $[d]_G(x)$.  As a consequence, subgroups of a formal group over a 
$p$-local ring must have degree $p^r$.  In particular, if $G$ is a formal 
group over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$, there is exactly one subgroup 
of degree $p^r$, given by $f(x) = x^{p^r}$, which is the kernel of the 
$r$-fold Frobenius isogeny $\Frob^r$.  

We have seen in remark \ref{rmk:star} that in $\DF(R)$ the degree 1 morphisms 
(when $r = 0$) are precisely the $\star$-isomorphisms of deformations.  In 
general, with morphisms corresponding to all $r \ge 0$, $\DF(R)$ is equivalent 
to the following category (\cff{proposition 16.9}{lpo}).  The objects of this 
category are $\star$-isomorphism classes of deformations $[G]$.  The morphisms 
are $\star$-isomorphism classes of pairs $[G > K]$: the source of $[G > K]$ is 
$[G]$, and the target of $[G > K]$ is $[G/K]$, where $G/K$ is a deformation of 
$\Gamma$ with $i_{G/K} = \sigma^r \circ i_G$ ($p^r$ being the degree of $K$).  
Moreover, by the Lubin-Tate theorem (\cff{theorem 3.1}{lubintate} and 
\cite[section 4.3]{H-Mthm}), there is at most one $\star$-isomorphism between 
any two deformations.  If $[G/K] = [G']$, then 
$[G' > K'] \circ [G > K] = [G > K'']$, where $K''$ is the kernel of the 
composite $G \to G/K \cong G' \to G'/K'$.  Thus deformations of Frobenius with 
source $(G,i,\alpha)$ correspond {\em exactly} to subgroups of $G$.  

\begin{exam}
\label{ex:K}
 Let $\Gamma$ be the multiplicative formal group over ${\mb F}_p$ of height 1.  
 For the multiplicative formal group $\Gm$ over a $p$-local ring $R$, since 
 the formal group law is defined by $1 + (x_1 +_\Gm x_2) = 
 (1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)$, we have $[p^r](x) = (1 + x)^{p^r} - 1 = x^{p^r}$.  Thus 
 the only subgroups of $\Gm$ are $\Gm [p^r]$ with $\CO_{\Gm [p^r]} = 
 \CO_\Gm / (x^{p^r})$.  Moreover, by the Lubin-Tate theorem 
 (\cff{theorem 3.1}{lubintate} and \cite[section 4.3]{H-Mthm}), every object 
 of $\DF(R)$ is $\star$-isomorphic to $\Gm$.  In particular the set of 
 $\star$-isomorphism classes of deformations of $\Gamma$ to $R$ is classified 
 by the ring $\CO_{\rm univ} = {\mb Z}_p$, and we can take the universal 
 deformation $G_{\rm univ}$ to be the multiplicative formal group over 
 ${\mb Z}_p$.  Thus by functoriality, to describe an object ${\cal B}$ of 
 $\Alg_\DF^{\rm tf}$, it is enough to give 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item a $p$-torsion free ${\mb Z}_p$-algebra $B = 
  {\cal B}_{{\mb Z}_p}(\Gm)$, 
  \item maps of ${\mb Z}_p$-algebras $\psi^{p^r}\co B \to B$ (corresponding to 
  the isogenies $[p^r]\co \Gm \to \Gm$) such that 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item $\psi^1 = {\rm id}_B$ and $\psi^{p^r} \circ \psi^{p^s} = 
   \psi^{p^{r+s}}$, 
   \item $\psi^p(b) \equiv b^p$ mod $pB$ (the Frobenius congruence).  
  \end{itemize}
 \end{enumerate}

 We note as in \cite[example 1.3]{cong} that this is a ``$p$-typicalization'' 
 of the original theorem of Wilkerson (\cff{proposition 1.2}{wilkerson}) 
 which characterizes the torsion free $\lambda$-rings in terms of the Adams 
 operations satisfying the Frobenius congruences at all primes.  More 
 concretely, let $K$ be the complex $K$-theory spectrum.  Then for 
 $B = \pi_0 A$, where $A$ is a $p$-complete $K$-algebra (commutative 
 $K$-algebra such that $A \cong A_p^\wedge$), $\psi^p$ recovers the $p$'th 
 Adams operation studied by McClure (\cff{chapters VIII and IX}{BMMS}).  
 \qed
\end{exam}

In general, consider the functor $X_r$ which associates to a ring $R$ the set 
of $\star$-isomorphism classes of pairs $[G > K]$ with $K$ a degree $p^r$ 
subgroup of $G$.  It is represented by the complete local ring $\CO_{X_r} = 
E^0 B\Sigma_{p^r}/I$, where $I = \sum_{0<i<p^r} 
{\rm Image}\big(E^0 B(\Sigma_i\times\Sigma_{p^r-i}) 
\xrightarrow{\rm transfer} E^0 B\Sigma_{p^r}\big)$ is the {\em transfer 
ideal} (roughly speaking, the corresponding power operation should be 
additive, so modulo the ``mixing terms'' in the Cartan formula); 
\cff{theorem 9.2}{strickland}.  This can be viewed as a generalization of the 
Lubin-Tate theorem for $\CO_{\rm univ} = \CO_{X_0}$.  Moreover there are two 
ring homomorphisms $s^*$, $t^*\co \CO_{\rm univ} \to \CO_{X_r}$, where $s^*$ 
represents the source map $[G > K] \mapsto [G]$, and $t^*$ represents the 
target map $[G > K] \mapsto [G/K]$.  (In example \ref{ex:K}, $\CO_{X_r} \cong 
\CO_{\rm univ}$ for all $r$, and $s^* = t^* = {\rm id}$.)  Thus to describe an 
object ${\cal B}$ of $\Alg_\DF^{\rm tf}$, it is enough to give 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item a $p$-torsion free $\CO_{\rm univ}$-algebra 
 $B = {\cal B}_{\CO_{\rm univ}}(G_{\rm univ})$, 
 \item maps of $\CO_{\rm univ}$-algebras 
 $\psi^{p^r}\co B \to B \otimes_{\CO_{\rm univ}}^{s^*} \CO_{X_r}$ as the 
 composite 
 \[
  B \stackrel{f^*}{\to} B \otimes_{\CO_{\rm univ}}^{t^*} \CO_{X_r} 
  \stackrel{{\cal B}_f}{\cong} {\cal B}_{\CO_{X_r}} (t^*G_{\rm univ}) 
  \xrightarrow{{\cal B}_{\CO_{X_r}} (\psi)} 
  {\cal B}_{\CO_{X_r}} (s^*G_{\rm univ}) 
  \stackrel{{\cal B}_g}{\cong} B \otimes_{\CO_{\rm univ}}^{s^*} \CO_{X_r}, 
 \]
 where $f = t^*$ and $g = s^*$ are local homomorphisms, and 
 $\psi\co s^*G_{\rm univ} \to t^*G_{\rm univ}$ is the universal deformation of 
 $\Frob^r$ (\cff{section 13}{strick}), 
\end{enumerate}
satisfying a set of formal properties.  In particular, if we denote by $u^*$ 
the map $\CO_{X_1} \to \CO_{\rm univ}/(p)$ which represents the universal 
Frobenius isogeny, the Frobenius congruence amounts to requiring that 
\[
 B \stackrel{\psi^p}{\to} B \otimes_{\CO_{\rm univ}}^{s^*} \CO_{X_1} 
 \xrightarrow{{\rm id} \otimes u^*} 
 B \otimes_{\CO_{\rm univ}} \CO_{\rm univ}/(p) = B/pB 
\]
be the $p$'th power map $B \to B/pB \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} B/pB$ which sends 
$x$ to $\bar{x}^p$.  

\begin{exam}
\label{ex:h2p2}
 Consider the elliptic curve $C_0 \subset {\mb P}_{{\mb F}_2}^2$ defined by 
 \[
  Y^2 Z + Y Z^2 = X^3, 
 \]
 which is supersingular so that its formal group $\widehat{C_0}$ is of height 
 2.  It has a universal deformation $C$ over  the Lubin-Tate ring 
 ${\mb W}{\mb F}_2 \llbracket u_1 \rrbracket \cong 
 {\mb Z}_2 \llbracket a \rrbracket$, with a choice of 3-torsion point, given 
 by 
 \[
  Y^2 Z + a X Y Z + Y Z^2 = X^3, 
 \]
 where $a$ is the Hasse invariant (\cff{2.2.10}{katzmazur} and 
 \cite[proposition 3.2]{tmf3}).  Setting $a=0$ we recover the supersingular 
 elliptic curve $C_0$.  Let $E$ be the Morava $E$-theory spectrum 
 associated to $C_0$, so that $\pi_* E = {\mb Z}_2 \llbracket a \rrbracket 
 [u^{\pm 1}]$ with $|u| = 2$.  The power operations on $E$ are constructed in 
 \cite[section 3]{Andu}, with explicit formulas computed in 
 \cite[sections 3 and 4]{h2p2}.  What follows is directly from the latter 
 reference.  

 By studying degree 2 subgroups, i.e.\thinspace{s}ubgroups of 2-torsion points 
 on $C$, we can identify $\CO_{X_1} \cong 
 {\mb Z}_2 \llbracket a,d \rrbracket / (d^3 - a d - 2)$: in the affine 
 coordinate chart $u = X/Y$, $v = Z/Y$, degree 2 subgroups are generated by 
 points $Q$ of the form $\big(u(Q), v(Q)\big) = (d, -d^3)$ such that 
 $d^3 - a d - 2 = 0$.  Thus we have a power operation 
 \[
  \psi^2\co E^0 X \to E^0 X \llbracket d \rrbracket / (d^3 - a d - 2).  
 \]
 Moreover, by studying the canonical isogeny with source $C$ and kernel the 
 degree 2 subgroup generated by $Q$ (\cff{theorem 1.4}{lubin}), Rezk computes 
 that 
 \[
  t^* (a) = \psi^2 (a) = a^2 + 3 d - a d^2
 \]
 (\cff{p.\thinspace{6}}{h2p2}).  There are also formulas for a set of 
 functions $Q_0(x)$, $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ which express 
 \[
  \psi^2 (x) = Q_0(x) + Q_1(x) d + Q_2(x) d^2.  
 \]
 In particular the Frobenius congruence takes the form $Q_0(x) \equiv x^2$ mod 
 2.  

 We will discuss in detail such calculations for Morava $E$-theories 
 associated to supersingular elliptic curves in section \ref{sec:p3}.  \qed
\end{exam}


\section{$K(1)$-local power operations}
\label{sec:K(1)}

In this section we discuss how to pass to the $K(1)$-local setting from the 
power operations at arbitrary height described in the previous section.  For 
general background of $K(1)$-local operations, see \cite{k1}.  

Let $F$ be an even-periodic $E_\infty$ ring spectrum such that $F^0$ is a 
$p$-torsion free, complete, noetherian, local ring with maximal ideal $\mf m$ 
containing $p$, and the mod-$\mf m$ reduction of the formal group over $F^0$ 
is of height $n < \infty$, and let $E = L_{K(1)} F$ be its 
$K(1)$-localization.  For example, the Morava $E$-theory spectrum associated 
to the supersingular elliptic curve in example \ref{ex:h2p2} is such an $F$.  
We write this spectrum as $E_2$, specifying its height.  

Henceforth when talking about a Morava $E$-theory and its $K(1)$-localization, 
we will use $F$ to denote the $E$-theory spectrum itself, and use $E$ to 
denote the $K(1)$-local spectrum which is primary to our study.  However, to 
avoid conflict with the usual notation in the literature, we reserve $E_2$ for 
the above Morava $E$-theory of height 2 (and in general a height 2 Morava 
$E$-theory which is an elliptic cohomology theory of interest), and we will 
write $L_{K(1)} E_2$ for its $K(1)$-localization.  

The general pattern of the relationship between $K(1)$-local power operations 
and the power operations in section \ref{subsec:subgp} is as follows: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 2) {$F^0$}; 
	\node (RT) at (3, 2) {$F^0 B\Sigma_p/I$}; 
        \node (LB) at (0, 0) {$E^0$}; 
	\node (RB) at (3, 0) {$E^0 B\Sigma_p/I$}; 
	\node at (4.2,0) {$\cong E^0.$}; 
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$\scriptstyle \psi^p$} (RT); 
	\draw [->] (LT) -- (LB); 
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$\scriptstyle L$} (RB); 
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [above] {$\scriptstyle \psi^p$} (RB); 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Recall that the top operation arises from the universal deformation of 
Frobenius which is represented by the ring $\CO_{X_1} = F^0 B\Sigma_p/I$.  The 
vertical maps are induced by the $K(1)$-localization $F \to E$.  In terms of 
homotopy groups, this is obtained by inverting the generator $u_1$ (so that 
the resulting formal group is of height at most 1) and completing at the ideal 
$(p)$, i.e.\thinspace$\pi_* F = {\mb W}k \llbracket u_1,...,u_{n-1} \rrbracket 
[u^{\pm1}]$ and $\pi_* E = 
{\mb W}k \llbracket u_1,...,u_{n-1} \rrbracket [u_1^{-1}]_p^\wedge 
[u^{\pm1}]$.  For example, we have 
\[
 \pi_0 L_{K(1)} E_2 = \varprojlim_i {\mb Z_2} (\!(a)\!) /(2^i) = 
 \left.\left\{\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_n a^n~\right|~c_n \in {\mb Z}_2, 
 \lim_{n \to -\infty} c_n = 0\right\} 
\]
(the Hasse invariant $a$ can be taken as the generator $u_1$).  In particular 
the formal group over $F^0$ obtains a unique degree $p$ subgroup after being 
pulled back to $E^0$, and the map $L$ classifies it.  We will explain this 
uniqueness of subgroup and the isomorphism at the bottom right corner shortly.  

In order to do calculations we need to examine $L$ more carefully.  Let 
$\mb G$ be a $p$-divisible group over a base scheme $X$, and $x \in X$ be a 
point whose local ring is complete and noetherian.  The restriction of $\mb G$ 
to $x$ lives in the following short exact sequence which is natural in 
$\mb G$: 
\[
 0 \to {\mb G}^{\rm for}_x \to {\mb G}_x \to {\mb G}^\text{\'et}_x \to 0, 
\]
where the subobject (the connected component of the identity) is the {\em 
formal} component, and the quotient is the {\em \'etale} component 
(\cff{section 2.2}{tate}).  The formal component ${\mb G}^{\rm for}_x$ is a 
formal group on $X$.  The localization 
$L\co F^0 B\Sigma_p/I \to E^0 B\Sigma_p/I$ factors through 
$E^0 \otimes_{F^0} F^0 B\Sigma_p/I$.  Along the base change 
$F^0 B\Sigma_p/I \to E^0 \otimes_{F^0} F^0 B\Sigma_p/I$, the special fiber of 
a $p$-divisible group that consists solely of a formal component may split 
into formal and \'etale components.  We want to take the formal component so 
as to keep track of the unique subgroup classified by $L$ which lands in the 
formal group over the ring $E^0 B\Sigma_p/I$.  

\begin{exam}
\label{ex:h1p2}
 We continue example \ref{ex:h2p2} in the $K(1)$-local setting.  After base 
 change to $L_{K(1)} E_2$, the universal elliptic curve $C$ has a unique 
 degree 2 subgroup in its formal component which is the canonical subgroup 
 introduced in \cite[theorem 1.4]{lubin}.  The degree 2 subgroup generated by 
 $(d,-d^3)$ is contained in the formal component if and only if $(d,-d^3)$ is 
 in the formal neighborhood of the identity $(0,0)$.  The equation 
 $d^3 - a d - 2 = 0$ which parametrizes degree 2 subgroups has a unique root 
 in ${\mb F}_2 (\!(a)\!)$, and Hensel's lemma implies that this lifts to a 
 root in $\pi_0 L_{K(1)} E_2 = {\mb Z}_2 (\!(a)\!)_2^\wedge$.  Plugging this 
 specific value of $d$ into 
 $\psi^2\co \pi_0 E_2 \to \pi_0 E_2 \llbracket d \rrbracket /(d^3-ad-2)$, we 
 get an endomorphism of the ring $\pi_0 L_{K(1)} E_2$, and this endomorphism 
 is the $K(1)$-local power operation.  For an application of this calculation, 
 see \cite[section 6]{level3}.  \qed
\end{exam}

Lastly we note that the commutative square on the previous page describes the 
pattern for $K(m)$-local operations with $m > 1$ as well, but the isomorphism 
at the bottom right corner is specific to the height 1 case.  

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:cong}
 $E^0 B\Sigma_p/I \cong E^0$.  
\end{lem}
This generalizes what we have seen in example \ref{ex:K} about the 
multiplicative formal group.  A formal group $\mb G$ of height 1 has a unique 
degree $p$ subgroup given by ${\mb G}[p]$, and the ring $E^0 B\Sigma_p/I$ 
classifying subgroups of degree $p$ is isomorphic to $E^0$.  Thus the power 
operation takes the form $\psi^p\co E^0 \to E^0$ which is a lift of the 
Frobenius map (\cff{section 4}{k1}).  In general a height $n$ formal group has 
more than one degree $p$ subgroup, as in the example of section \ref{sec:p3} 
where $n=2$ and $p=3$ (cf.\thinspace{r}emark \ref{rmk:subgroups}).  See 
\cite[theorem 42 and lemma 46]{strick} and \cite[section 1.4]{katzmazur} for 
details, and \cff{section 3.5}{Andu} for an approach of making power 
operations of higher height land in $E^0$.  
\begin{proof}[Proof of the lemma]
 First we identify $E^0 B\Sigma_p$ as the $E^0$-submodule of $E^0 BC_p$ fixed 
 by the action induced by ${\rm Aut} C_p \cong {\mb F}_p^\times$. This is a 
 special case of the calculations in \cite[section 12]{lpo}.  We have 
 \[
  B\Sigma_p \stackrel{\rm tr}{\longrightarrow} BC_p 
  \stackrel{\rm res}{\longrightarrow} B\Sigma_p, 
 \]
 where $\rm tr$ is the transfer map, and $\rm res$ is the restriction map.  
 Since $[\Sigma_p : C_p]$ is prime to $p$, the composite is a $p$-local 
 equivalence, and thus $p$-locally $B\Sigma_p$ is a retract of $BC_p$.  
 Moreover ${\rm Aut} C_p$ acts on $\Hom (C_p,\Sigma_p)$ as conjugation (it 
 preserves the ``cycle type'' of the element generating the image of $C_p$ in 
 $\Sigma_p$).  Thus two maps $C_p \to \Sigma_p$ that differ by an 
 ${\rm Aut} C_p$-action induce homotopic maps $BC_p \to B\Sigma_p$, and hence 
 the same map $E^0 B\Sigma_p \to E^0 BC_p$.  

 We calculate $E^0 BC_p$ by considering the cofiber sequence associated to the 
 construction of the Thom space 
 \[
  S(L^{\otimes p}) \to BS^1 \to (BS^1)^{L^{\otimes p}}, 
 \]
 where $L$ is the tautological complex line bundle over $BS^1$.  $E^* BS^1$ 
 can be calculated as $E^* \llbracket x \rrbracket$ with $|x| = 2$, where $x$ 
 is the first Chern class of $L$ (\cff{section 1}{coctalos}).  Recall that 
 $\pi_* E = {\mb W}k \llbracket u_1,...,u_{n-1} \rrbracket 
 [u_1^{-1}]_p^\wedge [u^{\pm1}]$.  By the Thom isomorphism and the 
 even-periodicity of $E^*$, the map on cohomology induced by the right-hand 
 map in the cofiber sequence can be identified as the $E^*$-algebra map 
 $E^* BS^1 \to E^* BS^1$ sending $x$ to $[p](x) = p x + \cdots + u_1 x^p + 
 \cdots$.  Also note that we can identify the sphere bundle $S(L^{\otimes p})$ 
 with $BC_p$.  Thus again as $E^*$ is even-periodic, the long exact sequence 
 induced by the cofiber sequence implies that $E^0 BC_p \cong 
 E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket / \big([p](x)\big)$.  

 For any $r \in {\mb F}_p^\times$, the induced action on $E^0 BC_p$ sends $x$ 
 to $[r](x) = r x + \cdots$.  Hence as the $E^0$-submodule of $E^0 BC_p$ fixed 
 by the ${\rm Aut} C_p$-action, $E^0 B\Sigma_p$ can be identified with 
 $E^0 \oplus \big(E^0 \cdot \prod_{r=1}^{p-1} [r](x)\big) \cong 
 E^0 \oplus \big(E^0 \cdot (x^{p-1} + \cdots)\big)$.  

 Next we identify the transfer ideal $I = \sum_{0<i<p} 
 {\rm Image}\big(E^0 B(\Sigma_i\times\Sigma_{p-i}) 
 \xrightarrow{\rm transfer} E^0 B\Sigma_{p}\big)$ as the second summand in 
 $E^0 B\Sigma_p$.  Similarly to the above, for all $0 < i < p$, we can 
 identify the composite 
 \[
  E^0 B(\Sigma_i \times \Sigma_{p-i}) \stackrel{\rm res}{\longrightarrow} 
  E^0 \stackrel{\rm tr}{\longrightarrow} 
  E^0 B(\Sigma_i \times \Sigma_{p-i}) 
 \]
 as multiplication by an invertible scalar, and thus 
 $E^0 B(\Sigma_i \times \Sigma_{p-i}) \cong E^0$.  Moreover by the 
 ``double-coset formula'' the composite 
 \[
  E^0 \stackrel{\rm tr}{\longrightarrow} E^0 B\Sigma_p 
  \stackrel{\rm res}{\longhookrightarrow} E^0 BC_p 
 \]
 has image the same as $E^0 \stackrel{\rm tr}{\longrightarrow} E^0 BC_p$.  
 Thus $I$ is generated by ${\rm tr}(1)$ as an $E^0$-module.  

 Define $\langle p \rangle(x) = x^{-1} \cdot [p](x)$ so that 
 $\langle p \rangle(x) = p + \cdots + u_1 x^{p-1} + \cdots$ and $E^0 BC_p = 
 E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket / \big( x \cdot \langle p \rangle(x) \big)$.  
 Write ${\rm tr}(1) = f(x) \in E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket$ by abuse of 
 notation.  We can identify the composite 
 \[
  E^0 \stackrel{\rm tr}{\longrightarrow} E^0 BC_p 
  \stackrel{\rm res}{\longrightarrow} E^0 
 \]
 as multiplication by $p$.  Since this composite sends $1$ to 
 ${\rm res}\big( f(x) \big) = f(0)$, we have $f(0) = p$.  Moreover since 
 $x \cdot {\rm tr}(1) = {\rm tr}\big( {\rm res}(x) \big)$ and 
 ${\rm res}(x) = 0$, $x \cdot f(x)$ is divisible by $[p](x)$.  We claim that 
 these two conditions on $f(x)$ forces it to be $\langle p \rangle (x)$.  
 Clearly $\langle p \rangle(0) = p$, and $\langle p \rangle(x)$ is annihilated 
 by $x$ in $E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket / 
 \big( x \cdot \langle p \rangle(x) \big)$.  Applying the snake lemma to two 
 rows of copies of 
 \[
  0 \longrightarrow E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket 
  \stackrel{\cdot x}{\longrightarrow} E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket 
  \longrightarrow E^0 \longrightarrow 0 
 \]
 with vertical maps being multiplication by $[p](x)$ on 
 $E^0 \llbracket x \rrbracket$ and zero on $E^0$, we see that any element 
 annihilated by $x$ is a multiple of $\langle p \rangle(x)$ by an element of 
 $E^0$.  As $p$ is not a zero-divisor in $E^0$, the claim follows.  Thus 
 $I \cong E^0 \cdot \langle p \rangle(x)$.  

 Finally as $u_1$ is invertible in $E^0$, $E^0 B\Sigma_p/I \cong E^0$.  
\end{proof}

We also note that at height 1, as in example \ref{ex:K}, the power operation 
$\psi^p$ determines the other $\psi^{p^r}$ with $r > 1$ by iterated 
composition.  Thus in the $K(1)$-local setting, among the operations 
$\psi^{p^r}$ it suffices to study only $\psi^p$ as above.  Moreover if the 
$K(1)$-local homotopy groups are {\em $p$-torsion free}, it turns out that 
$\psi^p$ determines {\em all} the power operations (\cff{section 3}{lpo}).  
For this reason we will simply write $\psi$ for {\em the} $K(1)$-local power 
operation.  At higher height, the relationship among these operations is more 
complicated.  


\section{Power operations at the prime 3}
\label{sec:p3}

In \cite{h2p2}, Rezk gives explicit calculations of the algebraic theory of 
power operations for a specific Morava $E$-theory of height 2 at the prime 2 
(cf.\thinspace{e}xample \ref{ex:h2p2}).  We record some calculations analogous 
to some of the results there, at the prime 3, together with calculations of 
the corresponding $K(1)$-local power operation.  

The Morava $E$-theory $F$ of height 2 that we consider here is associated to 
a supersingular elliptic curve over a field of characteristic 3.  Our 
calculations break into the following steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find the universal elliptic curve with a choice of 4-torsion  point, so 
 that a posteriori the supersingular elliptic curve that we are interested in 
 is one with the Hasse invariant zero; 
 \item Study the degree 3 subgroups of this universal elliptic curve.  In 
 particular we need to compute 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item the coordinate ring parametrizing degree 3 subgroups, 
  \item the equation of the quotient curve which is the image of the universal 
  degree 3 isogeny; 
 \end{itemize}
 \item $K(1)$-localize.  
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The universal elliptic curve with a choice of 4-torsion point}
\label{subsec:step1}

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 3.  First we note that a supersingular 
elliptic curve over $k$ cannot have a 3-torsion point.  Moreover, in order to 
have a {\em unique} lift of the elliptic curve together with a choice of 
$N$-torsion point along a deformation of $k$, $N$ must be prime to 3.  As the 
moduli stack ${\cal M}\big(\Gamma_1(2)\big)$ associated to a level 
$\Gamma_1(2)$-structure on the elliptic curve is not representable by a scheme 
due to the existence of nontrivial automorphism of order 2 
(\cff{corollaries 4.7.2 and 2.7.2}{katzmazur}), a natural choice for the 
universal elliptic curve is one equipped with a level $\Gamma_1(4)$-structure.  

The computation for the equation of the universal elliptic curve with a choice 
of 4-torsion point $P$ is analogous to \cite[2.2.10]{katzmazur} and 
\cite[proposition 3.2]{tmf3} where the universal elliptic curve for the prime 
2 case has a choice of 3-torsion point (cf.\thinspace{e}xample \ref{ex:h2p2}).  
In $xy$-coordinates, with the constraints that $P$ be at the origin, $2P$ be 
on the $x$-axis, and $4P$ be the identity at the infinity, we have the 
Weierstrass equation 
\[
 y^2 + a x y + a c y = x^3 + c x^2 
\]
over the graded ring ${\mb Z}_{(3)}[a,c]$, where $|a| = 1$ and $|c| = 2$.  The 
grading comes from the action of $\Gm = \Spec {\mb Z}[\lambda^{\pm1}]$ given 
by $a \mapsto \lambda a$ and $c \mapsto \lambda^2 c$.  By 
\cite[V.4.1(a)]{AEC}, the Hasse invariant can be computed as $h = a^2 + 4c$, 
so that over $k$ the curve is supersingular precisely when $h = 0$ (note that 
the minimal field of definition of this supersingular elliptic curve is 
${\mb F}_9$).  

To facilitate calculations, we work in the affine coordinate chart $c = 1$ of 
${\cal M}\big(\Gamma_1(4)\big)$ so that the elliptic curve is given by 
\[
 y^2 + a x y + a y = x^3 + x^2, 
\]
with the discriminant of the elliptic curve $\Delta = a^2(a + 4)(a - 4)$ and 
the Hasse invariant $h = a^2 + 4$.  This reduction is analogous to the one 
discussed in detail in \cite[section 4]{level3}.  In $uv$-coodinates, with 
$u = x/y$ and $v = 1/y$, the equation becomes 
\[
 v + a u v + a v^2 = u^3 + u^2 v 
\]
which is the form we will use most often later.  

We denote this elliptic curve by $\cal E$.  
\begin{rmk}
 We note that the curve $\cal E$, together with the universal elliptic curve 
 with a choice of 3-torsion point for the prime 2 case, give models for 
 studying power operations at {\em all} primes.  \qed
\end{rmk}

Let $F$ be the Morava $E$-theory associated to the restriction of $\cal E$ to 
the supersingular locus.  This locus consists of a single closed point, as 
the ideal $\mf m = (3,h)$ is the maximal ideal of the complete local ring 
$F^0 = {\mb Z}_9 \llbracket h \rrbracket$, where the Hasse invariant $h$ is 
taken as the generator $u_1$.  
\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:adelta}
 For later calculations, we note that both $a$ and $\Delta^{-1}$ lie in $F^0$.  
 In fact, let $i$ be an element generating ${\mb Z}_9$ over ${\mb Z}_3$ with 
 $i^2 = -1$, and let $f(x) = x^2 + 4 - h \in F^0 [x]$.  Then $F^0$ is complete 
 with respect to $\mf m$, and we have 
 \[
  f(i) = 3 - h \equiv 0~~{\rm mod}~f'(i)^2 {\mf m}.  
 \]
 Thus by Hensel's lemma, since $f'(i) = 2i$ is not a zero-divisor in $F^0$, 
 there is a unique root $b$ of $f$ such that 
 \[
  b \equiv i~~{\rm mod}~f'(i) {\mf m}.  
 \]
 As $f(a) = 0$, we can identify $a$ with $b$, and hence $a \in F^0$.  

 To see $\Delta = a^2(a+4)(a-4)$ is invertible in $F^0$, note that 
 \[
  \Delta = (h-4)(h-20) \equiv -1~~{\rm mod}~{\mf m}.  
 \]
 Thus $\Delta = m-1$ for some $m \in {\mf m}$.  Since $F^0$ is complete with 
 respect to $\mf m$, $-\sum_{i=0}^\infty m^i \in F^0$, and this is the inverse 
 of $\Delta$.  \qed
\end{rmk}


\subsection{Degree 3 subgroups}
\label{subsec:step2}

\subsubsection{3-torsion points}
\label{subsec}

In order to compute the coordinate ring parametrizing degree 3 subgroups, we 
need to find an equation characterizing the coodinates of a 3-torsion point.  

Given the elliptic curve 
\[
 {\cal E}\co y^2 + a x y + a y = x^3 + x^2, 
\]
$(x,y)$ is a 3-torsion point if and only if the division polynomial 
\[
 \psi_3 (x) = 3x^4 + (a^2 + 4) x^3 + 3a^2 x^2 + 3a^2 x + a^2 
\]
equals zero (\cff{exercise 3.7(d)}{AEC}; here $\psi_3$ is not to be confused 
with the power operation $\psi^3$).  (This polynomial is exactly what one gets 
for the characterization, away from the prime 2, of a flex point in terms of 
the second derivative $y''$ calculated by implicit differentiation.)  We want 
to translate this into $uv$-coordinates which are more convenient to work with 
in the formal neighborhood of the identity (in $xy$-coordinates, the identity 
is at the infinity).  In this way we will get a ``characteristic'' equation 
comparable to $d^3 - a d - 2 = 0$ in example \ref{ex:h2p2}, where $d$ was the 
$u$-coordinate of a 2-torsion point.  

From the formula of multiplication by 3 in $xy$-coordinates, we have 
\[
 [3](u,v) = \left( 
 \frac{\phi_3(\frac{u}{v})\psi_3(\frac{u}{v})}{\omega_3(\frac{u}{v})}, 
 \frac{\psi_3(\frac{u}{v})^3}{\omega_3(\frac{u}{v})}\right), 
\]
with notation following \cite[exercise 3.7(d)]{AEC}, and thus our preliminary 
equation is $\psi_3(\frac{u}{v}) = 0$.  Clearing the denominators in 
$\psi_3(\frac{u}{v})$ , we get 
\[
 \widetilde{\psi_3}(u,v) = 3u^4 + (a^2 + 4) u^3 v + 3a^2 u^2 v^2 + 3a^2 u v^3 
 + a^2 v^4.  
\]
To eliminate $v$, note that we can rewrite the equation of $\cal E$ as a 
quadratic equation in $v$: 
\[
 a v^2 + (1 + a u - u^2) v - u^3 = 0.  
\]
We then multiply $\widetilde{\psi_3}(u,v)$ by its ``conjugate'' 
$\widetilde{\psi_3}(u,v')$, where $v$ and $v'$ are conjugate roots of the 
above equation.  We get a degree 8 polynomial in $u$: 
\[
 ~f(u) = -3 - 3 a u + 8 u^2 - a^2 u^2 + 9 a u^3 - 6 u^4 + 6 a^2 u^4 + 7 a u^5 
 + a^3 u^5 + 3 a^2 u^6 + 3 a u^7 + u^8.  
\]
Thus if we denote by $(d,e)$ the coordinates of a 3-torsion point, $d$ must 
satisfy $f(d) = 0$.  
\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:rescale}
 According to section \ref{sec:K(1)}, in particular example \ref{ex:h1p2}, we 
 might expect that $f(u)$ have a unique root reduced to zero modulo 3 after 
 $h = a^2 + 4$ gets inverted, corresponding to the unique subgroup in the 
 formal neighborhood of the identity.  However, as we obtain $f(u)$ out of a 
 conjugation procedure, this is not exactly the case.  We have 
 \[
  f(u) \equiv u^2 (u + a)^6~~{\rm mod}~3, 
 \]
 and in view of $a \not\equiv 0$ by the invertibility of $\Delta = 
 a^2(a + 4)(a - 4)$ (cf.\thinspace{r}emark \ref{rmk:adelta}), such a root has 
 multiplicity 2 (corresponding to the two nontrivial elements in the 
 subgroup).  $f(u)$ is the best possible polynomial solely in terms of $u$ 
 that we have at this point, and in later steps we will have to ``rescale'' it 
 back to a degree 4 polynomial (cf.\thinspace{t}he polynomial $w(t)$ above 
 proposition \ref{prop}).  \qed
\end{rmk}

Next, for the coordinates $(d,e)$ of a 3-torsion point, we want to express $e$ 
in terms of $d$.  At the prime 2 (cf.\thinspace{e}xample \ref{ex:h2p2}), the 
relation $e = -d^3$ can be obtained by manipulating the division polynomial 
$\psi_2$ and its ``conjugate'' as above, or simply by computing the inversion 
formula for a 2-torsion point on the elliptic curve as in 
\cite[section 3]{h2p2}.  The prime 3 case is a little more involved.  

Using the Euclidean algorithm, we compute the gcd of 
\[
 A(v) = \widetilde{\psi_3}(u,v) = 3u^4 + (a^2 + 4) u^3 v + 3a^2 u^2 v^2 + 
 3a^2 u v^3 + a^2 v^4 
\]
and 
\[
 B(v) = a v^2 + (1 + a u - u^2) v - u^3~~\text{(rewriting the equation of 
 $\cal E$)}, 
\]
both of which vanish at $(d,e)$.  We have 
\[
 A(v) = B(v)Q_1(v) + R_1(v) 
\]
\[
 ~~~B(v) = R_1(v)Q_2(v) + R_2(v), 
\]
and it turns out that $R_2(e) = 0$ as a result of $f(d) = 0$.  Thus 
\[
 R_1(d,e) = p(d) + q(d) e = 0 
\]
is a relation between $d$ and $e$ which is linear in $e$.  As we have formulas 
for $p(d)$ and $q(d)$, we can compute the inverse of $q(d)$ by applying the 
Euclidean algorithm and find 
\[
 1 = m(d)q(d) + n(d)f(d) = m(d)q(d).  
\]
Thus 
\[
 e = -q(d)^{-1} p(d) = -m(d) p(d).  
\]
In the end we have a degree 7 polynomial $e = g(d)$, comparable to $e = -d^3$ 
in the prime 2 case: 
\[
 g(d) = -\frac{1}{(-4 + a) a (4 + a)} (-18 - 12 a d + 18 d^2 - 15 a d^3 + 
 4 a^3 d^3 + 2 d^4 + a^2 d^4 + a^4 d^4 
\]
\[
 - 6 a d^5 + 3 a^3 d^5 - 2 d^6 + 3 a^2 d^6 + a d^7).  
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
\]

To summarize, in this subsection we find two polynomials $f$ and $g$, so that 
any 3-torsion point with $uv$-coordinates $(d,e)$ satisfies $f(d) = 0$ and 
$e = g(d)$.  


\subsubsection{The universal degree 3 isogeny}

Now we are ready to compute the universal degree 3 isogeny, and thus the 
equation of the quotient curve which is its image. From there we can find a 
formula for the power operation 
$\psi^3\co F^0  \to F^0 \llbracket d \rrbracket / \big(f(d)\big)$, where 
$F^0 = {\mb Z}_9 \llbracket h \rrbracket$ (to be precise, the target should 
actually be a certain improved coordinate ring as promised in remark 
\ref{rmk:rescale}).  

To compute the coordinates $(u',v')$ of the isogeny, we follow the ``Lubin 
isogeny'' construction (\cff{proof of theorem 1.4}{lubin}).  Let 
$P = \big(u,v(u)\big)$ be a general point on $\cal E$, and 
$Q = \big(d,e(d)\big)$ be a 3-torsion point.  For $v(u)$, we use the equation 
of $\cal E$ rewritten as a quadratic equation 
\[
 a v^2 + (1 + a u - u^2) v - u^3 = 0.  
\]
We take the first few terms (up to at least $u^9$ for our purpose) in the 
power series expansion of the root satisfying $v(0)=0$ (in the formal 
neighborhood of the identity).  For $e(d)$, we use the polynomial $g(d)$ 
computed at the end of section \ref{subsec}.  We set 
\[
 u' = u(P) u(P-Q) u(P+Q), 
\]
and similarly for $v'$.  By computing the inversion and addition formulas for 
the curve $\cal E$, we can write down formulas for $u' = \alpha u + \cdots$ 
and $v' = \beta u^3 + \cdots$ in terms of the uniformizer $u$ (at the 
identity) and parameters $a$ and $d$.  For example, 
\[
 \alpha = -\frac{1}{(-4 + a) (4 + a)}(-18 - 12 a d + 2 d^2 + a^2 d^2 
 - 15 a d^3 + 4 a^3 d^3 + 2 d^4 + a^2 d^4 + a^4 d^4 
\]
\[
 - 6 a d^5 + 3 a^3 d^5 - 2 d^6 + 3 a^2 d^6 + a d^7).  
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
\]
\begin{rmk}
 In order to have the equation of the quotient curve in the Weierstrass form, 
 we need to include an adjusting constant factor $\alpha^3 / \beta$ into $v'$ 
 by multiplying it to the original formula of $v'$.  This factor is comparable 
 to the term $-1$ appearing in the formula for $u'$ in 
 \cite[p.\thinspace{6}]{h2p2}.  \qed
\end{rmk}

We then solve for the Weierstrass equation which $u'$ and $v'$ satisfy.  The 
equation of the quotient curve turns out to be 
\[
 v + r u v + r v^2 = u^3 + u^2 v, 
\]
where 
\[
 r(a,d) = -\frac{1}{(-4 + a) (4 + a)}(-126 a + 28 a^3 - a^5 + 120 d - 9 a^2 d 
 + 3 a^4 d + 258 a d^2 - 67 a^3 d^2 
\]
\[
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+ 3 a^5 d^2 - 152 d^3 + 208 a^2 d^3 - 40 a^4 d^3 + 
 a^6 d^3 + 198 a d^4 - 33 a^3 d^4 - 3 a^5 d^4 + 8 d^5 
\]
\[
 + 63 a^2 d^5 - 15 a^4 d^5 + 70 a d^6 - 17 a^3 d^6 + 24 d^7 - 6 a^2 d^7).  
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
\]
Comparing the above equation with that of $\cal E$ 
\[
 v + a u v + a v^2 = u^3 + u^2 v, 
\]
we see that $\psi^3(a) = r(a,d)$.  As $d \equiv 0$ mod 3 
(cf.\thinspace{r}emark \ref{rmk:rescale}), we check that 
$\psi^3(a) \equiv a^3$ mod 3 which is the Frobenius congruence at height 1.  

Lastly we compute the coordinate ring which is the target of the power 
operation $\psi^3$.  

Set $t = g(d)/d$, the reciprocal of the $x$-coordinate of a 3-torsion point.  
This is a quantity that is invariant under negation using the group law of 
$\cal E$, since the $x$-coordinate of any point on the elliptic curve is 
invariant under negation (\cff{III.2.3(a)}{AEC}).  Moreover, as the reciprocal 
of the $x$-coordinate, $t$ is ``distinguishable'' from the identity, since in 
$xy$-coodinates the identity is at the infinity.  In view of $f(d) = 0$, we 
compute that $t$ is the root of a quartic polynomial 
\[
 w(t) = a^2 t^4 + 3 a^2 t^3 + 3 a^2 t^2 + (a^2 + 4) t + 3 
\]
which has a {\em unique} root reducing to zero modulo 3.  
\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:subgroups}
 We note that via the relation $t = 1/x$ this polynomial $w(t)$ recovers the 
 division polynomial $\psi_3(x)$.  Thus the eight roots of $f(d)$ together 
 with $d = 0$ correspond to the nine 3-torsion points on $\cal E$, and the 
 four roots of $w(t)$ correspond to the four degree 3 subgroups consisting of 
 3-torsion points, one of which lies in the formal neighborhood of the 
 identity.  \qed
\end{rmk}
The equation of $\cal E$ implies that $d$ satisfies a quadratic equation in 
terms of $t$: 
\[
 (t + 1) d^2 - a t (t + 1) d - t = 0.  
\]
From this equation and $w(t) = 0$, we can rewrite $\psi^3(a) = r(a,d)$ above 
in terms of $t$ which lands in the correct target ring.  

We summarize the above calculations as follows.  
\begin{prop}
\label{prop}
 \mbox{}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item The universal degree 3 isogeny with source $\cal E$ is defined over 
  the ring 
  \[
   F^0 \llbracket t \rrbracket / 
   \big(a^2 t^4 + 3 a^2 t^3 + 3 a^2 t^2 + (a^2 + 4) t + 3\big), 
  \]
  and has target the elliptic curve 
  \[
   y^2 + r x y + r y = x^3 + x^2, 
  \]
  where 
  \[
   r(a,t) = a^3 t^3 + 3 a^3 t^2 + 3 a^3 t - 4 a t + a^3 - 3 a.  
  \]
  The kernel of this isogeny is generated by the 3-torsion point whose 
  $x$-coordinate is $1/t$.  
  \item The power operation $\psi^3\co F^0  \to F^0 \llbracket t \rrbracket / 
  \big(a^2 t^4 + 3 a^2 t^3 + 3 a^2 t^2 + (a^2 + 4) t + 3\big)$ is given by 
  \[
   \psi^3(h) = (t + 1)^3 h^3 - (22 t^3 + 69 t^2 + 75 t + 27) h^2 + (128 t^3 + 
   424 t^2 + 512 t + 201) h 
  \]
  \[
   - 16 (14 t^3 + 49 t^2 + 65 t + 27), 
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  \]
  \[
   \psi^3(a) = (t + 1)^3 a^3 - (4 t + 3) a.  
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \qed
  \]
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}


\subsection{$K(1)$-localize}
\label{subsec:step3}

As in example \ref{ex:h1p2}, with $h = a^2 + 4$ invertible, we can solve for 
$t$ 3-adically from the equation $w(t) = 0$ by first writing 
\[
 t = -\frac{1}{a^2 + 4}(a^2 t^4 + 3 a^2 t^3 + 3 a^2 t^2 + 3) 
\]
and then substituting $t$ recursively.  Plugging this uniquely determined 
value of $t$ into $\psi^3(h,t)$ and $\psi^3(a,t)$ computed in proposition 
\ref{prop}, we get the $K(1)$-local power operation $\psi$ as an endomorphism
