If E is an E_\infty-ring spectrum, one has a ring \Gamma of power 
operations on E^*. As I understand it (and I am a total novice when it 
comes to power operations), the pair (E^*, \Gamma), together with some 
structure maps, forms a small category object in co-commutative coalgebras 
(over the integers).

I would really like to work in a dual setting, and think about 
co-small-category objects in commutative rings, instead. One can just take 
continuous linear duals of everything, but it would be much more 
satisfying to know that the continuous linear dual of \Gamma is actually 
some kind of ring of power co-operations on E_*. This would fit very 
nicely with how things work for stable operations and unstable additive 
operations, and it would also let you use some algebraic geometry to think 
about power (co-)operations. Are there basic ideas about power 
co-operations anywhere in the literature?

Thanks,
Andrew S.

Andrew,

There are subtleties about making sense of this, starting with the fact
that E^*BG may not be a nice (e.g., free, or dual of a free) E^*-module,
even if G is finite abelian.  

It's not about power operations per se, but you might want to look at
the papers by Andrew Stacey and Sarah Whitehouse, especially "The
Hunting of the Hopf Ring".  They have a formalism for dealing with
unstable co-operations, i.e., describing unstable operations of a theory
E in terms of the Hopf ring of E.  If you want to link up with algebraic
geometry, this is probably something to look at.
