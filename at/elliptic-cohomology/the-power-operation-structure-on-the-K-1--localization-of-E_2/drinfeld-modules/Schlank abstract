Title: Ultra-Products and Chromatic Homotopy Theory.
Abstract: Let $C_{p,n}$ be the $K(n)$-local category at height $n$ and
prime $p$. These categories are of great interest to the stable homotopy
theorist since they serve as a the “associated  graded” pieces of the
chromatic filtration on the category of spectra. It is a well known
observation that for a given height $n$ certain “special” phenomena happen
only for small enough primes. Further, in some sense, the categories
$C_{p,n}$ become more regular and algebraic as $p$ goes to infinity for a
fixed $n$. The goal of this talk is to make this intuition precise.

Given an infinite sequence of mathematical structures, logicians have a
method to construct a limiting one by using “ultra-products”. We shall
define a notion of “ultra-product of categories” and then describe a
collection of categories $D_{n,p}$ which will serve as algebro-geometric
analogs of the $K(n)$-local category at the prime $p$.

Then for a  fixed height $n$ we prove:

$$\prod_p^{\mathrm{Ultra}} C_{n,p}  \cong \prod_p^{\mathrm{Ultra}}
D_{n,p}.$$

If time permits we shall describe our ongoing attempts to use these methods
to get a version of the $K(n)$-local category corresponding to formal
Drinfeld modules (instead of formal groups).

This is a joint project with N. Stapleton and T. Barthel.
