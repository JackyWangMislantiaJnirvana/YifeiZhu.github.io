I seem to recall a direct construction of K(pi,n) as a topological group
not by interating B or W or ...
Anyone have a reference?

The infinite symmetric product SP^infty(S^n) is a nice model for 
K(Z,n), and then there is M.C.McCord's generalization that gives 
K(pi,n).  See the beginning of the Math Review that I have copied 
below.  These are all obviously commutative monoids, and it seems to 
me that naturality in the pi variable should give the inverse when 
applied to -: pi --> pi.

If $X$ is a topological space with base point * and $G$ is a 
topological monoid with unit $e$, let $B(G,X)$ be the reduced monoid 
of singular 0-chains of $X$ with coefficients in $G$, i.e., the set of 
all functions $(X,\ast)\rightarrow(G,e)$ with finite support. The 
author shows that $B(G,X)$, suitably topologized, has very remarkable 
properties, and that it generalizes several basic constructions of 
algebraic topology. For example, $B({\bf Z}^+,X)=\text{SP}^\infty X=$ 
infinite symmetric product of $X$, $B(G,S^n)=K(G,n)=$ 
Eilenberg-MacLane complex if $G$ is a discrete abelian group, 
$B(G,[0,1])\rightarrow B(G,S^1)$ is a numerable universal $G$-bundle 
if $G$ is a topological group such that $\ast\rightarrow G$ is a 
cofibration.

Dear Jim,

It is simply the free pi-module generated by the 
sphere of dimension n with the identification 
that 0 = base point (Theorem of Dold-Thom).

I remember Dold explaining to me that,
to arrive at a group, rather than taking 
the free monoid on a Moore space, one takes the free group on
(or the quotient group of the free monoid on) the Moore space.

Since there seems to be some interest in these models for K(A,n)'s, 
here is a little more info about McCord's construction B(A,X), where A 
is an abelian topological monoid, and X is a based space.

1. B(A,X) is again an abelian topological monoid, and an abelian 
topological group if A was.

2. with N = the natural numbers. B(N,X) = SP^infty(X).

3. With A = a discrete abelian group, B(A,S^n) = K(A,n).

4. The category of abelian topological monoids is tensored over based 
spaces, and B(A,X) = X tensor A.

5. Since S^n = S^1 smash S^1 ... smash S^1, one sees that B(A,S^n) IS 
obtained from iterating the `bar construction' B(_,S^1).  But writing 
it as B(A,S^n) reveals much more symmetry, e.g. a natural action of 
the monoid Omega^nS^n.

6. There is an evident filtration on B(A,X) that leads to 
configuration spaces and stuff.

As a reference for this, besides McCord's own paper, see my paper: 
 Kuhn, Nicholas J. The McCord model for the tensor product of a space 
and a commutative ring spectrum.  Categorical decomposition techniques 
in algebraic topology (Isle of Skye, 2001),  213--236, Progr. Math., 
215, Birkh?user, Basel, 2004.  I also consider allowing A to be things 
like commutative S-algebras.

Here is a golden oldy.  Jim, this may be from when you were a graduate
student,  before my time anyway, so it might be what you remembering.
In any case, I'll take this as a teaching or preaching opportunity.

There is a beautiful and long forgotten construction of
K(\pi,n) as a simplicial abelian group that makes the
representability of cohomology utterly transparent.
It is due to Adrien Douady and can be found in expos\'e 9
of Volume I of the 1958/59 S\'eminaire Henri Cartan,
``Invariant de Hopf et operations cohomologique secondaires''.

Briefly, the abelian group of q-simplices of K(\pi,n) is just
the normalized simplicial n-cochains with coefficients in \pi
of the standard simplicial q-simplex \Delta_q.  Since the
\Delta_q are the objects of a cosimplicial set, it is
immediate that this definition prescribes a simplicial
abelian group.

Starting from this definition, Douady proves directly that
K(\pi,n) represents cohomology, and it follows as a corollary
that it has the right homotopy groups to be a K(\pi,n).

I was working in this area in 1960-61 for my thesis on function spaces, 
determining k^Y where k is a cohomology operation and Y is a space, so I 
hope this background will be helpful.

Dold had a preprint giving a rather combinatorial description of the 
functor say Phi from  chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups, and 
this is used by others, such as David Epstein, but, as Michael Barratt 
put it to me, Kan cast a huge light on this area by describing Phi(A) in 
dimension n as the chain maps from the normalised chains of the 
n-simplex to A; this can be thought of, analogously to what Peter says,  
as the cochains of the n-simplex with coefficients in the chain complex 
A, and this was the view I took in my thesis published in part as

 3. ``Cohomology with chains as coefficients'', {\em Proc.London Math. 
Soc.}  (3) 14 (1964), 545-565.

Actually while taking the view of replacing the \pi in K(\pi,n) by a 
chain complex I discovered the Dold-Kan theorem - too late! The reason 
for doing this replacement was that if Y was a simplicial set then 
K(\pi,n)^Y could be considered as K(C^*(Y, \pi),n),  with the right 
conventions. This involves the various exponential laws in chain 
complexes and simplicial abelian groups. And Andre Joyal has recently 
looked again at the other tensor product on chains obtained from the 
equivalence with simplicial abelian groups, and the natural tensor 
there, as those who were at CT2010 will know.

Another facet of the Dold-Kan  equivalence is the paper of A.L. Blakers

Blakers, A. Some relations between homology and homotopy groups. {Ann. 
of Math. (2)} \textbf{49} (1948) 428--461.

who defines a `group system', now called a crossed complex, and using 
relative homotopy groups defines for a filtered space (with X_0 a 
singleton) what we call the fundamental crossed complex. This paper uses 
the homotopy addition lemma for a simplex. I heard from Michael Barratt 
in the late 1950s that it was suddenly realised in Princeton that this 
had not been proved: so who to ask to prove it? The answer was shown in
Hu, S.-T. {The homotopy addition theorem}.Ann. of Math. (2) {58} (1953) 
108--122.

Blakers also assigns  to a reduced crossed complex, C, a simplicial set 
which nowadays we would call the nerve NC of C, and which in dimension n 
can also be seen as the cochains of the n-simplex with coefficients in 
the (partially nonabelian) crossed complex C. The functor N gives an 
equivalence between crossed complexes and simplicial T-complexes 
(Ashley's theorem, 1978, in his PhD).
