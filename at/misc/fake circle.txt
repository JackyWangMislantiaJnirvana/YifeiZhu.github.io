Guys,

Who can remind me an example of a map $f: X \to Y$ of CW spaces such that

(1) $f$ induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups;

(2) $f$ induces an isomorphism of homology (integral);

(3) $f$ is NOT a homotopy equivalence.

[ALGTOP-L] examples

Some people asked me to forward the examples to the list. I do it.


1. here is john moore's favorite example of such a map, a so-called fake 
circle.  look at the universal cover to recall that \pi_2 (S1 \vee S2) = 
Z[\pi] where \pi = <T> = the infinite cyclic group generated by T.  Let 
\alpha = 1-2T and X be the attachment of a 3-cell to S1 \vee S2 by 
\alpha.  then the inclusion S1 \to X is such a map since the fundamental 
group and the homology groups are isomorphic but \pi_2(X) = Z[1/2].

(The similar example I got from Norio Iwase, and Greg Arone mentioned 
that this is in the book of Hatcher, ex. 4.35.)

2. First a little context: if you sharpen condition (2) to: (2)' "f 
induces an isomorphism of homology with arbitrary twisted coefficients", 
then (1) and (2)' imply "f is a homotopy equivalence".

Therefore guidance toward an example of the kind you want comes from 
considering the equivariant homology of universal covers of the spaces 
involved. It leads you quickly to something like this:

    A v B --- include --> A x B

with A = K(Q,1)=M(Q,1) and B any Moore space of the form M(T,k), T a 
torsion group, k as needed.

Hope this helps,

3. Mapping torus of a "multiplication by 2" map on a mod-3 Moore space, 
projecting down to S1.  More generally the projection T -> S1 for T the 
mapping torus of a map f:X -> X such that

- X is simply connected but not contractible,
- f_* (the map on homology) is an isomorphism,
- (f_*-1) is an isomorphism.

4 There are high dimensional knots with pi_1 of the complement isomorphic
to S1. These knots are not trivial. The complements X have maps X -> S1
satisfying your criteria.
