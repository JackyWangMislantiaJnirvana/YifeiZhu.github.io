I think the important things to do for a computer talk are:

1. Make sure there's not too much information on your slides.  I think
I've heard Bryna give a no more than 7 lines/slide rule of thumb, which is
good.

2. Practice a lot, so you know what you want to say on the different slides.
I've recently decided that printing a copy of the slides and writing notes
about what to say when is a big help.

3. Relax and don't try to say too much.  Think of a short talk as a
"preview" for your work, in the sense of a movie.  So there probably won't
be proofs.  And you probably won't be able to be super specific.  But
there should be some things called "Theorem (Z)".

It can help to make a sort of outline on paper before you make the slides.
